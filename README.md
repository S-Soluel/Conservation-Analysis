# Conservation Analysis
In this program I took information from .csv files related to 'Biodiversity in National Parks' in the United States, and converted the given information into data that could be used to develop a graph of ratios of species. In this case, I had created a ratio comparing 'Non-Native Species per At Risk Species.'
- Disclaimer: I do not know if there are practical uses for the ratio I observed, at the time I was just looking to see what I could make of the data.
